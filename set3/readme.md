TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I learnt how to put a dataset into vs code by importing Pandas. I chose a dataset I wanted to work with for the data project, the impact of the 2020 bushfires on local water bodies, and continued to watch the tutorial and import four datasets onto the new repo I created - Data Project. 
I am yet to learn how to create different types of graphs but I have an idea of what content I want to display in my project.
