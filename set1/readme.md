TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I learnt how to print Hello World! as well as how to clone a copy of the me repo. At first, the process was overwhelming but once I began following the steps it became easier to understand. I am still not overly sure what everything means yet but I am looking forward to learning more and beginning to understand better. 
We had to run tests and pass them by typing python ../course/set1/tests.py
