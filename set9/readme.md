TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I continued to focus on the data project, completing more research and developing a focused area of understanding. I began delving into what happens in the lakes after bushfires occur, and how they can affect the lakes in the long term. This information allowed me to find out that lakes can be negatively affected by bushfires for years afterwards. This can be due to limited shade over the lakes as there are less trees, causing water to overheat and reduced insects falling into the lakes, providing not as much food for fish. 
I am still working on how to achieve maps of each lake. The issue is that I cannot find data that provides this information such as a shapefile. I also am struggling to find a csv or shapefile of the bushfires locations as this would be helpful in being able to map it out.
